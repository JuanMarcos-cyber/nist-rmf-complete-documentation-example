## 🌐 Overview

This repository provides a **complete, end-to-end NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** documentation package for a cloud-native e-commerce platform (*eCommerceCo*).

It is designed as a **professional GRC / cybersecurity portfolio project**, demonstrating:

- Full RMF documentation (Prepare → Monitor)  
- Cloud-native security mapping (AWS + GCP)  
- Tailored NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 controls  
- Risk-based decision-making  
- Realistic security architecture, evidence strategies, and governance structures  
- Clean, human-readable `.md` files optimized for GitHub  
- A fully structured example of what an RMF package looks like in a real organization  

This project is ideal for demonstrating skills relevant to:

- GRC Analyst / Consultant  
- Cybersecurity Analyst  
- Cloud Security  
- Risk Management  
- Compliance (PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR)  
- RMF / NIST 800-53  
- Audit Readiness  
- Security Governance & Documentation
